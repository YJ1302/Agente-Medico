# DECISIONS LOG — UPeU Internado 360

Architectural and business decisions, with rationale. Newest first.

### D-032 · PostgreSQL is a first-class target; SQLite-only assumptions fixed in place (Render deployment prep)
**Decision:** Preparing for deployment, `DATABASE_URL` is normalized in
`app/config.py` (`postgres://` → `postgresql://` → `postgresql+psycopg://`)
so a managed Postgres connection string works without edits, and
`app/main.py`'s startup hook now only runs `Base.metadata.create_all` on
SQLite — on Postgres, schema is owned exclusively by `alembic upgrade head`
(run as the first half of the production start command), so the app can
never silently create a table with no matching migration. Verified against a
real PostgreSQL 16 container: two real bugs were found and fixed directly in
their original migrations/models rather than patched with a follow-up
migration, since neither has been applied to a real deployed database yet —
(1) `migrations/versions/e6118382e890...` rebuilt `activity_definitions` by
drop+recreate, which SQLite allowed with a dangling FK from
`student_activities` but Postgres rejects
(`DependentObjectsStillExist`); the migration now drops/recreates that named
foreign key around the rebuild only on Postgres. (2)
`Evaluation.status` was `String(20)` while
`EvaluationStatus.RETURNED_FOR_CORRECTION` is 24 characters — SQLite never
enforces `VARCHAR` length so this was invisible there; Postgres raises
`StringDataRightTruncation`. Widened to `String(30)` in both the model and
the baseline migration. **Why:** SQLite is intentionally permissive
(ignores FK enforcement by default and never enforces `VARCHAR(N)` length),
so both bugs were 100% silent in every local/test run until exercised against
a real Postgres server — exactly the class of issue "the tests pass" cannot
catch when the target production database differs from the dev database.

### D-030 · Deterministic query + optional LLM phrasing, not LLM-driven retrieval (Phase 3A)
**Decision:** The AI Coordinator Assistant always resolves a question to one
of 11 fixed intents with plain keyword/substring matching against the
caller's own scoped records, then runs a plain repository query for that
intent. An LLM, if configured, is called **only afterwards** to phrase the
already-computed result as prose; it never receives database access, a
schema, or free-form retrieval instructions, and removing it changes only the
wording of the answer, never its content. **Why:** the spec requires the
assistant to "use deterministic database queries first" and "never send the
whole database to the model." Letting an LLM parse the question into a
query (e.g. text-to-SQL) would make the actual data returned depend on model
behavior, which is unauditable and could not guarantee the per-role/per-sede
scope this codebase enforces everywhere else (`ReportService`,
`GradeService`, `authorization.py`). Keeping retrieval 100% deterministic
means the worst a misbehaving or adversarial question can do is fail to
match any intent — it can never expand what data is reachable.

### D-031 · Grade-related assistant questions inherit the `/grades` RBAC boundary (Phase 3A)
**Decision:** `grade_components_missing` and `cross_sheet_inconsistencies`
are registered with `ROLES_GLOBAL_ONLY` (Admin + University Coordinator),
matching `GradeService`'s existing rule that Sede Coordinators never see the
raw grade matrix (Batch 2F). The assistant's `can_ask()` re-checks this
per-question, independent of the route-level `require_management` guard.
**Why:** without a second per-intent check, any coordinator role able to
reach `/assistant` could ask a grade question in natural language and bypass
the narrower `/grades` boundary — defense in depth mirrors the
already-established pattern of route guard + record-level scope predicate
(`authorization.py`) used throughout the codebase.

### D-029 · Admin reopen targets `in_progress`, not a new "reopened" status (Batch 2D)
**Decision:** Administrator reopen of an approved evaluation transitions it to
`in_progress` (editable by the tutor again), recording `reopened_at`/
`reopened_reason` on the row rather than introducing a sixth status value.
**Why:** mirrors D-026's reasoning for activities — the prior approval history
(`reviewed_at`/`reviewed_by_user_id`/`review_comments`) is preserved on the
same row and via the audit log; a dedicated status would be functionally
identical to `in_progress` in every query and view.

### D-028 · One adaptive evaluation detail page, not six separate templates (Batch 2D)
**Decision:** `evaluation_detail.html` renders the tutor scoring form,
read-only submitted view, coordinator review panel, returned-for-correction
banner and approved view all from one template, conditioned on role and
`ev.status` — plus a separate standalone `evaluation_print.html` for the
genuinely different printable layout. **Why:** consistent with
`rotation_detail.html`'s established pattern (Batch 2B) of one state-aware
page over duplicated near-identical templates; the printable view is kept
separate because its layout (no sidebar/topbar, print-optimized) is
structurally different, not just a permission variant.

### D-027 · Catalog uniqueness via index, not NOT NULL column (Batch 2C)
**Decision:** `activity_definitions.code` uniqueness is enforced with a
separate `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`, while the column itself stays nullable at the
SQLite schema level; the application always supplies a code (validated as
required). **Why:** the pre-existing table already had 4 rows before the
migration; a NOT NULL+UNIQUE column added in one step has no safe single
default for multiple existing rows. Backfilling with `'LEGACY-' || id` then
indexing achieves the same real-world guarantee without a risky migration step,
consistent with D-022's "prefer app-level enforcement when SQLite ALTER is
unsafe" precedent.

### D-026 · Correction reuses the same row; "corrected" is a review action, not a status (Batch 2C)
**Decision:** `StudentActivity` status values are `draft`, `pending`,
`verified`, `rejected`, `cancelled` — five, not six. A rejected entry's
correction transitions the **same row** `rejected → pending`; the correction
itself is recorded as an `ActivityReview` row with `action="corrected"`,
alongside the earlier `action="rejected"` row, so nothing is overwritten.
**Why:** the spec listed `corrected` as a transitional state, but persisting it
as a resting status would be indistinguishable from `pending` in every
practical sense (queries, alerts, UI) while doubling the number of states to
reason about. The review history — not a status enum value — is what actually
needs to preserve "this was corrected."

### D-025 · Interface language toggle (chrome-level i18n) (Batch 2B)
**Decision:** Added a session-based ES/EN toggle (`app/i18n.py`) that translates
the persistent **chrome** (navigation, top bar) via a local dictionary; page
bodies remain Spanish. **Why:** the UI is authored in Spanish per requirements;
a full body-level i18n of every template is out of scope for this batch. Fully
offline (no external translation service). Full-page EN translation is a
documented future enhancement.

### D-024 · Conflict overrides are Admin-only, reason-mandatory, audited (Batch 2B)
**Decision:** Institution mismatch, EsSalud community rotation and far-outside
period dates are blocking but override-able only by an Administrator supplying a
reason (`override_rotation_conflict` audit + `override_reason` on the record).
Workload/duration are non-blocking warnings requiring confirmation. **Why:**
spec §6/§10 — human-in-the-loop, traceable exceptions without hard-coding
unsupported academic rules.

### D-023 · Automatic pending evaluation on completion (Batch 2B)
**Decision:** Completing a rotation creates one `pending` evaluation with the 15
official criteria (shared `evaluation_catalog.py`), never duplicated. Full score
capture stays in a later batch. **Why:** spec §11; centralizes the criteria used
by both seed and runtime.

### D-022 · Rotation lifecycle fields added; SQLite ADD COLUMN migration (Batch 2B)
**Decision:** Added nine `rotation_assignments` columns (notes, reasons,
lifecycle timestamps, created/updated_by). The migration uses plain
`op.add_column` (not batch mode) because SQLite batch-recreate fails on the
table's pre-existing unnamed foreign keys ("Constraint must have a name"); the
two user references are added as plain nullable integers (the ORM keeps the
ForeignKey for relationships / future PostgreSQL). **Why:** preserve existing
data and keep the migration reliable on SQLite.

### D-021 · Tutor workload is a configurable warning, not a hard block (Batch 2A)
**Decision:** Added `TUTOR_ASSIGNMENT_WARNING_THRESHOLD` (default 5). A tutor
over the threshold is flagged (normal/near/above) but assignment is never
blocked by workload alone. **Why:** spec F forbids inventing a strict official
medical limit; a configurable warning is the safe, honest model.

### D-020 · `tutor_profiles.specialty` added (Batch 2A)
**Decision:** Added a `specialty` column separate from `service`. **Why:** the
Batch 2A spec lists Specialty and Clinical service as distinct tutor fields; the
Part 1 model only had `service`.

### D-019 · `is_principal` models one active coordinator per sede (Batch 2A)
**Decision:** Added `sede_coordinator_profiles.is_principal` (default true). A
sede has at most one *active* principal coordinator; assigning another triggers
a controlled replacement (previous deactivated + audited). **Why:** spec E/F —
explicit is clearer than inferring "principal" from activity alone, and it keeps
room for future secondary coordinators. Migration `7fb2a9a545a7` uses a
`server_default` so existing rows migrate as principal without data loss.

### D-018 · Server-side authorization added (Part 2 repair)
**Decision:** Introduced `app/authorization.py` with `require_roles(...)` route
guards and record-level scope helpers; applied guards to admin/management routes;
added a styled 403 page and `authorization_denied` auditing. **Why:** Part 1
only enforced authentication — hidden sidebar links were not a security
boundary. Corrects the false RBAC claim in `dependencies.py`. (Repairs audit
items A.1–A.8.)

### D-017 · Audit logging activated
**Decision:** Added `AuditService` writing the previously-unused `AuditLog`
model, with a key denylist so passwords/tokens/patient data never enter the
payload. **Why:** Rulebook R4 requires important actions to be auditable.

### D-016 · Assets served locally (offline requirement)
**Decision:** Chart.js and Bootstrap Icons (CSS + woff/woff2 fonts) are vendored
under `app/static/vendor/` and served by the app; all CDN references removed.
**Why:** Part 2 requirement L — the full interface, icons and charts must render
without internet. **Supersedes D-014.** No proprietary fonts are bundled; system
fonts remain per UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md.

### D-015 · Tutor functions verified from the official 2026 document
**Decision:** The tutor PDF was successfully text-extracted and the tutor's
official functions confirmed: supervise/orient the intern's practical-assistance
activities, coordinate scheduling with the sede, review clinical topics,
**evaluate professional competencies, and register/submit evaluations and grades
to the Coordinator of Internship**. This validates BR-13/BR-14. **Why:** audit
item A.9 — replaces the earlier inference-only assumption (see revised A-1).

### D-014 · Browser CDN assets (icons, charts) kept optional *(superseded by D-016)*
**Decision:** Bootstrap Icons and Chart.js loaded from a CDN in Part 1; the app
was functional without them. **Superseded in Part 2** by fully local assets.

### D-013 · One current academic period guaranteed
**Decision:** The seed marks exactly one period `is_current`; if "today" falls
in a gap it marks the nearest period. **Why:** the dashboard and rules assume a
single current period (BR-04).

### D-012 · Alerts deduplicated against open alerts
**Decision:** `AlertService` only creates an alert if no equivalent open alert
exists (same category + entity). **Why:** the dashboard refreshes rules on each
load; without dedup, alerts would multiply.

### D-011 · Non-admin dashboards reuse a shared shell
**Decision:** Only the administrator dashboard is fully built; other roles use
`dashboard_role.html` with role-specific welcome text and placeholder cards.
**Why:** explicit Part 1 scope; the operational dashboards arrive in Part 2.

### D-010 · JSON stored as TEXT for agent/audit payloads
**Decision:** `agent_executions.findings_json`, `recommended_actions_json` and
`audit_logs.detail` are TEXT holding JSON. **Why:** SQLite portability and
simplicity now; can migrate to native JSONB on PostgreSQL later.

### D-009 · Session-cookie auth (not JWT) for Part 1
**Decision:** Use Starlette signed session cookies. **Why:** simplest secure
option for a server-rendered app; http-only + same-site mitigates common
attacks. JWT/API auth can be added when an API/SPA is introduced.

### D-008 · Deterministic agents, no external AI in Part 1
**Decision:** Agents are mock/deterministic with a fixed, LLM-ready interface.
**Why:** the spec forbids external AI in Part 1 and requires explainable,
human-approved automation. The interface lets real AI drop in later unchanged.

### D-007 · Human-in-the-loop enforced in the model
**Decision:** `AgentResponse.requires_human_approval` and
`Alert.requires_human_action` are first-class fields. **Why:** BR-26/BR-27 —
detection and recommendation never become autonomous action.

### D-006 · Soft-delete + active state instead of hard deletes
**Decision:** Mixins add `is_active`, `is_deleted`, `deleted_at`. **Why:**
preserve history and future audit integrity (Rulebook R4).

### D-005 · Integer surrogate keys in Part 1 (UUID deferred)
**Decision:** Use autoincrement integer PKs consistently now. **Why:** simpler,
smaller and faster on SQLite for a demo; the repository layer hides the key
type, so a later UUID switch (better for distributed/production systems) is
contained. Trade-off recorded per the spec's "UUIDs or well-designed integer
IDs" allowance.

### D-004 · Evaluation instrument modeled exactly from the 2026 format
**Decision:** Three areas (Conocimientos, Desempeño, Actitudinal), five criteria
each, 0–4 scale; area score = sum, final = average of areas; the 15 criteria
texts are seeded verbatim. **Why:** fidelity to `FORMATO DE EVALUACION INTERNO`
(BR-17…BR-21).

### D-003 · Bimonthly academic periods (six per year)
**Decision:** Model the year as six bimonthly periods (Ene-Feb … Nov-Dic).
**Why:** the programming spreadsheet organizes rotations in bimonthly columns;
this also matches the ~365-day internship (BR-03).

### D-002 · MINSA vs EsSalud modeled as `InstitutionType`
**Decision:** A dedicated table with `placement_method` and
`has_community_component`. **Why:** BR-05…BR-08 — MINSA uses ranking and adds a
community component; EsSalud uses examination. Keeps sedes and students linked to
one provider system without duplication.

### D-001 · 2026 documents prioritized over 2024
**Decision:** Where facts differ, 2026 documents win (e.g. tutor/coordinator
functions, evaluation format). The 2024 activity lists inform the activity
catalog only. **Why:** explicit project rule (Rulebook R2).

### D-030 · 2026-07-15 · Polymorphic Attachment & StatusHistory (Batch 2E)
**Decision:** A single `attachments` table (`owner_type` + `owner_id`) and a
single `status_history` table serve both documents and incidents, instead of
four separate tables. **Why:** identical structure and security rules; halves
the model/repository/template surface without weakening scope (the owning
service always re-checks view scope before returning a file).

### D-031 · 2026-07-15 · Server-side numbering via a counter table
**Decision:** `DOC-YYYY-NNNN` / `INC-YYYY-NNNN` codes are allocated from
`document_sequences` with an atomic in-transaction increment; a UNIQUE
constraint on the code is the final backstop and creation retries on collision.
**Why:** deterministic, sequential-per-year, concurrency-safe on SQLite (which
serializes writers) and portable to Postgres. Codes are never user-editable.

### D-032 · 2026-07-15 · Local PDF/Excel, no paid services
**Decision:** Excel via **openpyxl**, PDF via **fpdf2** (pure-Python, offline;
pulls Pillow + fonttools). PDF text is coerced to latin-1-safe for the core
fonts. **Why:** the environment has no internet/paid services; both libraries
are lightweight and produce real downloadable files. Documented in
`REPORT_CATALOG.md` / `FILE_UPLOAD_SECURITY.md`.

### D-033 · 2026-07-15 · Confidentiality is enforced server-side, redacted in alerts
**Decision:** `visibility` (`normal | restricted | confidential`) is enforced in
service scope helpers, not in templates; confidential incident titles are
redacted in rule/alert text and never appear in audit summaries. **Why:**
hiding UI is never the boundary; confidential data must not leak through
notifications or dashboard snippets (SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY_RULES.md). Institutional
legal/privacy review remains required before production.

### D-034 · 2026-07-15 · Agents never mutate documents/incidents
**Decision:** `DocumentAgent` and `IncidentMonitoringAgent` are deterministic
(no LLM); they only detect and recommend, always with
`requires_human_approval=True`. **Why:** the platform's core rule — human
approval is always required; no document is sent and no incident is closed
automatically.

### D-035 · 2026-07-15 · Grade imports reuse the generic import pipeline
**Decision:** ``GradeImportBatch``/``GradeImportRow`` are realised through the
generic ``ImportBatch``/``ImportRow`` with ``profile == "grade_components"``,
instead of separate tables. The grade *domain* (schemes, component definitions,
per-student components, history) has its own tables. **Why:** identical
upload/preview/validate/confirm/history/audit machinery; the batch and source
sheet/row/column are still preserved on every ``StudentGradeComponent``.

### D-036 · 2026-07-15 · Import reuses service validation, commits once
**Decision:** The import pipeline reuses each entity service's ``_validate`` (and
the rotation conflict engine) for the dry-run, and persists a whole batch in a
single transaction using repository writes that only ``flush`` (the public
service methods' per-row ``commit`` is not used). **Why:** business rules stay
authoritative and are never bypassed, while ``all_or_nothing`` gets true
all-or-none semantics (a single commit / rollback).

### D-037 · 2026-07-15 · No final grade without confirmed weights
**Decision:** Component ``weight_percent`` may be null and
``GradeScheme.weights_confirmed`` gates any final-grade computation; until then the
UI shows "Fórmula pendiente de confirmación" and nothing is calculated. **Why:**
the client has not confirmed the official weights; the future Academic Grade Agent
must never invent them (GRADE_IMPORT_RULES.md).

### D-038 · 2026-07-15 · Blank vs zero in grade cells
**Decision:** A blank grade cell is stored as ``score = NULL`` (not registered) and
is always kept distinct from a real ``0``; a blank never erases an existing value.
**Why:** explicit client rule — zero must remain distinguishable from missing.

### D-039 · 2026-07-15 · Real-workbook audit confirmed compatibility; no rebuild
**Decision:** The client's official "BASE DE DATOS - NOTAS INTERNADO MÉDICO 2026"
workbook (7 sheets: `QX 2026`, `INT. CIRUGÍA`, `INT. MEDICINA`,
`REV. MED. QUIR III`, `INT. PEDIATRÍA`, `INT. GO`, `REV. MED. QUIR IV`) was read
end-to-end through the existing Batch 2F pipeline without any change to the
reader, validator or import service — header-row detection, blank-vs-zero, and
student-key resolution all worked correctly against the real structure. Two
targeted additions were made rather than a rebuild: (1) `excel_reader.
read_category_band()` extracts the merged "Actitudinal/Desempeño/Conocimiento"
band above the header row (read-only mode does not expose merge metadata, so a
second bounded normal-mode load is used only for this small band, not the full
sheet), and (2) `GradeService.cross_sheet_report()` compares student rosters
across confirmed batches for the "present in one sheet, absent in another"
scenario, which had been explicitly deferred as a limitation. **Why:** proves
the general-purpose profile-driven design (D-035/D-036) generalizes to the real
file without bespoke per-sheet code, and closes the one documented gap the real
data exposed.

### D-040 · 2026-07-15 · Static import routes must precede dynamic ones
**Decision:** `GET /grades/cross-sheet-check` is registered before
`GET /grades/{scheme_id}` in `grade_routes.py`. **Why:** FastAPI matches routes
in registration order; with the int-typed dynamic route first, a request for the
static path was being captured as `scheme_id="cross-sheet-check"` and failing
type coercion (422) before ever reaching the intended handler. Found via the
5-role smoke test, fixed, and locked in with
`test_cross_sheet_check_route_not_shadowed_by_scheme_detail`.

## Ambiguities & assumptions

- **A-1 · Tutor functions — RESOLVED in Part 2.** The tutor PDF (`FUNCIONES DE
  TUTOR DE INTERNADO 2026.pdf`) was successfully text-extracted and the tutor's
  official functions confirmed (see D-015). The earlier Part 1 inference is now
  **verified against the source document**; BR-13/BR-14 stand as written. This
  assumption is closed.
- **A-2 · Sede name spellings vary** across the spreadsheet (e.g. "José Agurto
  Tello / Argurto"). Seed sedes use clean, fictional-but-representative names; no
  real roster is imported.
- **A-3 · Real student data ignored by design.** The Excel contains real DNIs and
  names; per R1 these are **not** used. All seeded people are invented.
- **A-4 · Community component** is modeled as a non-core `RotationType` for MINSA
  rather than a separate subsystem, pending Part 2 requirements.
- **A-5 · CSRF tokens** are deferred to Part 2 (state changes already use POST +
  same-site cookies); documented in SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY_RULES.md.
